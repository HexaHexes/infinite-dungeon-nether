# Infinite Dungeon: Nether

A new dungeon dimension for [Infinite Dungeon](https://github.com/HexaHexes/infinite-dungeon),
with its own dungeon portal.

Its theme comes from the *Dungeon Crawl - Dimensional Patch* `dc_dp_the_nether`
datapack (Curse project 1189484, file 6137049), which serves as the content
blueprint.

Scaffolded from [neoforge-mod-template](https://github.com/HexaHexes/neoforge-mod-template).
Implementation is gated on the profile-driven core of the main repo: issues
#162 and #163. The plan lives in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` there (sections 3,
16, 19, 20).

Sibling addons: infinite-dungeon-nether, -better-nether, -end, -better-end,
-outer-end, -aether, -blue-skies, -undergarden.

Status: scaffold only - no gameplay content yet.

Status: dependencies wired; the dimension, profile and content port follow
(the port issue, charter #1).

## Design note

The addon is a companion mod in the suite's module posture (plan section 19,
the I32 platform posture in the API's integration record): it depends on the
infinite-dungeon-api platform, never on the Infinite Dungeon core mod, and
degrades to a no-op by absence - without this mod the dimension simply does
not exist and the core suite is untouched.

- **Dimension and portal (plan section 3, applied to a second dimension):**
  the addon ships one dungeon dimension with its own portal rules via an
  `infinite_dungeon` dimension profile - layer/floor limits, curve overrides,
  spawn pools, portal policy and announcement keys. The core's portal paths
  resolve every rule per dimension (profile first, config default behind).
- **Deterministic placement (plan section 16):** the mirror structure set
  carries its own fixed salt, so pregenerated and organic worlds place the
  dimension's dungeon identically from the first tick - the Chunky/Distant
  Horizons compatibility contract.
- **The content blueprint:** the dc_dp_the_nether datapack's structures,
  pools and theming port under the org's porting rules. Dungeon Crawl's
  natural generation stays disabled on this dimension (the core ruling, plan
  section 18): the addon's structure set is the sole placement authority.
- **Economy surface (plan section 20):** staged chest loot and treasure feed
  the guild's reward pipeline like the core dimension's do.
